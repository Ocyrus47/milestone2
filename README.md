This is a responsive "Recipe Finder" app allowing the user to search their input for various catogeries of dishes. 

## SDLC Process

### Planing
I decided to build a responsive recipe finder web app to align the project with assisting my cousin to learn cooking. Planing was taken into consideation with a view for further recipes to be added to the portfolio. 

### Analysis
Carried out research with individuals in my community who were keen on learning to cook. Most of them answered they use various cook books to find new dishes and recipes. Which meant for a certain recipe cook book a price was very high and it was often clunky to carry around while cooking. A recipe finder app with a simple search capabilities for various dishes and recipes would be more costeffective and give the developers capabilites to update new recipies on user demand.

### Design
The structure and UI of the app has been designed to ensure simplicity and ease of navigation to suit its intended audience.

### Implementation
Researched on the best practice for implementation process and applied agile methodology. Changes were made in conjuction with quick sprint session with volunteers on UI/UX. 

### Testing
Used manual and auto testing method by direct input. Screen shots and details of testing below.

### Maintainance
I will carry out maintainance by my own account via Gitpod (VS Code) and Github. I am looking to implement further functionalities and upgrade UI/UX features.

## User Experience (UX)

### App contents

- Header with logo and search input field.
- Search button to allow the use to execute search for recipe
- Keywords manuel for users to search the recipe. 

### Target Audience

- keen individuals interested in trying different recipes
- Rookie indivisuals interested in learning to cook or bake
- Individuals looking to explore new recipies
- Anyone with cooking hobby

### Project purpose

It starded from an idea for my sister when she left for her University. Being away from home and not have being the best cook we discussed how she would be able to cook as someone who didn't cook. 

The purpose of this app is to equip anyone who is looking to learn how to cook or bake. The app must be very simple and specific to finding dishes and recipes. It must have very good design principles allowing the user to vision ther end product and facilitae them to view the recipe very quickly. 


### User stories

<ol>
    <li>As a new user, I do not want to go through the process of creating a profile to view recipies.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able see the recipe contents available in the app.</li>
    <li>A a user, I want to be able to navigate through the app UI seamlessly.</li>
    <li>A a user, I want to be able to view the the dish images and the name along with the recipe.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to use the app in my mobile and ipads so I can follow the recipe while cooking.</li>
</ol>

### Project Scope

- Create a sign up process allowing the user to login the app and favourite certain dish and recipe. 
-  Creating comment sections in for each recipe to build user cummunity.


## Accessibility

The site has been built with accessibility in mind to ensure that it is always a positive experience.

This has been achieved by:
- Semantic HTML.
- Choosing fonts and colours with high contrast.
- Adequate aria-labels for interactive features.
- Adequate alt attributes for images.
