## The principles or manual and automated testing

### Manual Testing

Manual testing is a process in software testing where testers manually execute test cases without relying on automation tools. The main goal is to identify defects, bugs, or issues by ensuring that the application's features function as intended, based on the specified requirements.

During manual testing, testers simulate end-user interactions with the software to verify its functionality, usability, and overall performance.

#### When to Use Manual Testing

Manual testing is suitable for the following scenarios:

<ul>
<li>Exploratory Testing: When test cases are not well-defined, and the tester needs to explore the software.
</li>

<li>Usability Testing: To evaluate the user-friendliness and overall experience.
</li>

<li>Short-term Projects: When the project timeline is brief and does not justify the setup of automation.
</li>
</ul>

### Automated Testing

Automated testing, also known as automation testing, is a software testing method where test cases are executed automatically using specialized tools, scripts, and frameworks. Unlike manual testing, which requires human intervention, automated testing relies on predefined scripts to efficiently handle repetitive, complex, and time-consuming tests.

Its primary goal is to enhance testing speed, accuracy, and coverage while minimizing human involvement, especially in regression, performance, and large-scale testing.

#### When to Use Automated Testing

Automated testing is most beneficial in the following scenarios:

<ul>
<li>Regression Testing: To quickly verify that recent code changes havenâ€™t introduced new bugs.
</li>

<li>Load and Performance Testing: To evaluate how the application performs under different conditions.
</li>

<li>Repetitive Tests: When tests need to be run frequently, such as nightly builds or continuous integration pipelines.
</li>

<li>Data-driven Testing: For tests that require multiple iterations with different input data.
</li>
</ul>

## Testing

This app code was validate by using W3C CSS Validation Service, W3C Markup Validation Service and lighthouse. 

Testing was conducted throughout the entire project development phase. Google Developer Tools and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) were utilized to identify errors and troubleshoot any issues that arose during development.

Automated testing helps catch problems quickly and saves time by letting the computer do repetitive tasks instead of the developer.
