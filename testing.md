## Testing

This app code was validate by using W3C CSS Validation Service, W3C Markup Validation Service and lighthouse. 

Testing was conducted throughout the entire project development phase. Google Developer Tools and [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) were utilized to identify errors and troubleshoot any issues that arose during development.

Automated testing helps catch problems quickly and saves time by letting the computer do repetitive tasks instead of the developer.
